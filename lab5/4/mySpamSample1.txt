Hello

I am Mrs.Lisa Banneth, a staff of BANK BICIA-B

here in Burkina Faso. I am very
sorry about this sudden mail as I know it might

come as a surprise banging
into your private life especially when we have

not met before. It was an
urgent need for a foreign partner, which has

pushed me to send you this
proposal. I know we have not met before, but I

am very optimistic that we
might be able to establish the necessary trust

needed to execute this
project.

I just need your services in a confidential

matter regarding (fund) in my
bank.This requires a private arrangement.

You will receive these funds under legitimate

arrangement that will protect
both of us. All legal documents will be

carefully worked out to ensure a
risk free transfer. 50% of the total sum would

be your own portion at the
end of this deal.

The said sum is the profit / interest my branch

realized during a period of
10 banking years. Further details will be sent

to you as soon as possible.

So if you are willing to assist, please get

back to me soonest.

Thanks as I expect to hear from you soon.

My dearest regards.
